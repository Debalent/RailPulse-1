To help you explore RailPulse efficiently, here’s a quick guide to the project structure and key files:

- **frontend/src/components/**
	- `SensorCard.js`: Displays sensor data for individual equipment.
	- `RiskGraph.js`: Visualizes operational risks and trends.
	- `MaintenanceTimeline.js`: Shows maintenance history and upcoming events.
- **frontend/src/pages/**
	- `Overview.js`: Main dashboard for system-wide status.
	- `EquipmentDetail.js`: Detailed view for specific equipment.
- **frontend/src/App.js**: Entry point for the React application.
- **backend/src/main/java/com/railpulse/controller/**
	- `SensorController.java`: Handles API requests for sensor data.
- **backend/src/main/java/com/railpulse/model/**
	- `SensorData.java`: Data model for sensor readings.
	- `MaintenanceEvent.java`: Data model for maintenance events.
- **backend/src/main/java/com/railpulse/repository/**
	- `SensorRepo.java`: Data access layer for sensors.
- **backend/src/main/java/com/railpulse/service/**
	- `PredictionService.java`: Business logic for predictive analytics.

Start by reviewing the `Overview.js` page for a high-level dashboard, then explore components and backend services for deeper functionality. Each module is documented and modular for easy understanding and extension.
